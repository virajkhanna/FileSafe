# FileSafe
FileSafe is a simple and secure way to encrypt and decrypt your files. It uses the AES-256 Military Grade encryption algorithm to encrypt your files, and the decryption key is your password. This means that only you can decrypt your files, as long as you remember your password! Please note that if your forget or lose your password, your files CANNOT be recovered.

### How to Use
            
1. Click Browse, and choose a file
2. Choose your file, and click open. You'll then be asked to confirm the file, and click on "Confirm!" to do so. Make sure the file size is less than 10 MB, as that's the maximum file size!
3. You'll be asked whether you want to encrypt or decrypt the file, choose the relevant option and proceed.
4. Enter a password to encrypt or decrypt the file, if it's already encrypted. Remember that if you lose or forget this password, your file CANNOT be recovered, and you proceed at your own risk. We use AES-256 Military Grade encryption for this, to ensure your files are always secure from prying eyes!
5. Click "Encrypt/Decrypt!", and you'll be able to download your encrypted/decrypted file!
